**Flask Number Guessing Game**
A simple web application built with Flask that implements a number guessing game. Users can guess a number within a specified range, and the application provides feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

**Features**

-> Input fields are used to set the lower and upper bounds of the number range.

-> Input field for entering the guess.

-> Feedback on the guess compared to the randomly generated number.

**Technologies Used**
Python: A programming language for developing the application.
Flask: Web framework used to create the web server.
HTML: Markup language used for creating the web interface.
Math Module: Used for calculating the number of guesses.
